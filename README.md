# Weather App
The goal of this project was to create a weather app using React and the OpenWeather API: https://openweathermap.org/current

The app allows you to search for a location and get live weather data. The weather icon changes dependent on the weather at the searched for location, and the background changes dependent on time of day. It's also possible to toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
